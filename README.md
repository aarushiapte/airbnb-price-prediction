# Predictive Analysis of Airbnb Listing Prices in New York

## Overview
This project employs various machine learning models to predict Airbnb listing prices in New York. The analysis uses a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, providing over 100,000 records detailing various attributes of Airbnb listings. We explore the influence of features such as location, amenities, host verification status, and more on the pricing strategies employed by hosts.
